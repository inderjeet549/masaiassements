Fixes and Improvements Explanation

### 1. Prevented Element Overlapping
Issue: The `.box` elements were using `position: absolute;`, causing them to overlap.
Fix: Changed `position: absolute;` to `position: relative;`, ensuring they remain in the normal document flow.

### 2. Ensured Correct Box Sizing
Issue: Elements were expanding incorrectly due to missing box-sizing rules.
Fix: Applied `box-sizing: border-box;` globally to include padding and border in element dimensions.

### 3. Properly Aligned Elements Using `display` and `position`
Issue: `.container` was using `display: block;`, which didnâ€™t align elements properly.
Fix: Changed it to `display: flex;` with `justify-content: center;` and `gap: 20px;` for spacing.

### 4. Adjusted Text Positioning
Issue: The `.text` element was using `position: fixed; left: 50%;`, but was not properly centered.
Fix: Used `position: absolute; left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%);` for correct centering.

### 5. Improved Responsiveness
Issue: Layout did not adapt to smaller screens.
Fix: Added a media query (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) that makes `.container` stack vertically for better mobile support.

### Final Result:
- No overlapping issues.
- Proper spacing and alignment.
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes.
- A clean and structured webpage following best practices.

Now, the webpage layout is fully functional, properly aligned, and responsive! ðŸš€
